- a simple port scanner in Java that checks the status (open/closed) of ports on a target machine.
 - Use Java's Socket class to establish connections and determine port availability.
 - Make sure to replace "127.0.0.1" with the actual IP address or hostname of the target machine you want to scan.
 - If you want to scan your network from within, you can use the IP address assigned to your local machine. In most cases, this would be the loopback address, which is 127.0.0.1. This address always refers to the local machine, and you can use it to scan ports on your own system.
 - Adjust the startPort and endPort variables to define the range of ports you want to scan.
 - Note: Port scanning can be subject to legal and ethical considerations. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any network or system, and be aware of the legal implications associated with port scanning activities. Unauthorized port scanning is considered unethical and may be against the law.
 - As for typical port ranges, different types of services commonly use specific port ranges. Here are some commonly used port ranges:

Well-known Ports (0-1023):

Ports in this range are reserved for well-known services. For example:
80: HTTP
443: HTTPS
21: FTP
22: SSH
25: SMTP
Registered Ports (1024-49151):

Ports in this range are assigned to user applications or protocols. Some examples:
8080: HTTP alternative
3306: MySQL database
5432: PostgreSQL database
Dynamic and/or Private Ports (49152-65535):

These ports are used for dynamic/private purposes, and they are not assigned centrally. They are often used for ephemeral or temporary purposes.
